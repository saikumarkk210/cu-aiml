## Introduction
Inspired by Michelangelo's enduring words, "I am still learning," I embrace every opportunity to enhance my skills, 
whether it's mastering a new culinary recipe or delving into a new programming language. 
My academic background includes a degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 
Despite this, I have yet to engage in real-world projects beyond the confines of my school curriculum.


The Machine Learning and AI MicroBootCamp, hosted by Columbia University, NY, offered a timely opportunity to rekindle 
my passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This program equipped me with fundamental skills, tools, 
and insights essential in today's dynamic landscape of machine learning and emerging AI technologies including:
* Supervised Learning
* Machine Learning Optimization
* Neural Networks & Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processing

The curriculum of Machine Learning and AI MicroBootCamp encompassed:

**Project: 1:**
Application of supervised learning techniques to analyze data and predict outcomes.

**Project: 2:**
Utilization of neural networks and deep learning methodologies to develop a model for predicting the likelihood of borrowers repaying their student loans.

Both projects were implemented using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf)
